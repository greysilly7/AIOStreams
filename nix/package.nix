    # satisfied and skips everything, since pnpmConfigHook already
    # materialized node_modules (just without scripts). This reliably

    # scripts (better-sqlite3: "prebuild-install || node-gyp rebuild",
    # yencode: "node-gyp rebuild", plus yencode is also a patched
    # dependency). Build each directly: find wherever pnpm placed it in
    # the content-addressed store and run its own install script by
    # hand. `pnpm --dir <path> run install` (not a bare `node-gyp
    # rebuild`) reuses pnpm's own PATH/env setup for locating
    # node-gyp — a bare `node-gyp` isn't on PATH outside that.
